    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral with Soft Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a filterable card-based layout. A top navigation bar allows users to filter activities by category ('Advocacy', 'Outreach', 'Morale', 'Arts & Culture'). This structure was chosen over a static table to provide a more engaging, mobile-friendly, and user-directed experience. Users can quickly find activities relevant to their interests. Clicking a card expands it to show detailed logistics, keeping the initial view clean and scannable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Strike activity list -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Presentation Method: Interactive, filterable HTML cards -> Interaction: Category filtering buttons, expandable details on each card. Justification: This method allows users to easily digest a large list of qualitative information by breaking it down into manageable, user-selected categories. It promotes exploration without overwhelming the user. Method: Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic rendering and interaction, Tailwind CSS for styling. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
